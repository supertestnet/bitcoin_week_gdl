        <h1>Bitcoin Week</h1>
        <p>
            Talentland is from the 21â€”24 of April. We have 4 events for Bitcoin Week during Talentland:
        </p>
        <p>
            (1) We will have a stand at Talentland. We will also be sharing the booth with a bitcoin company called Kapitalex and we will be giving away bitcoin gifts, educational material, info about our community, and invitations to our other events during Bitcoin Week.
        </p>
        <p>
            (2) Our regular BTC/GDL meetup is scheduled for April 22. This one will have a couple of workshops along with time for socializing and networking.
        </p>
        <p>
            (3) A Carne Asada is scheduled for April 24. We're gonna have food catered, along with decorations, music, drinks, and a bitcoin pinata similar to this one: https://stacker.news/items/817809. This particular event is invite only and we're trying to create a list of 30 to 50 people to attend.
        </p>
        <p>
            (4) The launch of the National Bitcoin Association of Mexico is an event to be held by Kapitalex. They want to start this organization and announce its creation during Talentland. I think it's a non-profit, but I don't know much about it yet, and I'm hoping to learn more as we approach launch day. The launch day is not yet scheduled.
